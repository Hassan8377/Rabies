# rabies_minion
Repository of material for rabies virus genomic surveillance using MinION sequencing.  
Includes resources and datasets used for sequences in publication "Rapid in-country sequencing of whole virus genomes to inform rabies elimination programmes" (Brunker et al, In Prep).  

#Primer schemes  
Multiplex primer schemes for rabies virus whole genome sequencing, designed using Primal Scheme (http://primal.zibraproject.org/)  
rabvTanzDg= primers designed to target Tanzanian rabies virus  
rabvSEasia= primers designed to target SE Asia lineages of rabies virus  

#Protocols  
Full "sample-to-sequence" laboratory protocol for sequencing rabies virus samples on the MinION platform

#Sequence data  
Rabies virus consensus sequence datasets used for the publication "Rapid in-country sequencing of whole virus genomes to inform rabies elimination programmes" (Brunker et al, In Prep).
